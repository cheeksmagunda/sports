# Items requiring human action

Each entry: date, blocker, what was tried, what unblocks it. Empty list is
the desired state. Items here never block the build; the autonomous loop
proceeds with everything that does not depend on the blocked item.

## Operator action items

These are not strict NEEDS_HUMAN entries - the build works without them.

1. **Seed REALSPORTS_STORAGE_STATE_B64GZ on Railway.** [DONE 2026-05-27]
   Set on cron-job1 + cron-job2.

2. **Pin a stable WNBA_DEVICE_UUID env var on each cron service.** [DONE
   2026-05-27] Pinned to the UUID captured during first login.

3. **Stand up a corpus parquet from cumulative `slate_labels` rows once
   the live collector has ~30 slates of data** (~2-3 weeks). Then run
   `oracle-train` against that parquet, set the resulting SHA on
   `WNBA_ORACLE_MODEL_ARTIFACT_SHA`, and start the shadow window.
   _Wall-clock blocker; depends on the cron pipeline accumulating
   data._

4. **Tune `CONTRARIAN_STRENGTH` env var once you have 7-14 finalized
   slates.** Default 0.2 (basketball-main NBA value). [WIRED 2026-05-27]
   Operator can flip the value on Railway without a code deploy. Tune
   up to 0.3 in top-1 regime (variance is asset), down to 0.1 in
   cash games.

5. **Wire RotoWire `injury_status` into `features/build.py`.** [DONE
   2026-05-27] Hookup landed in commit `797ceac` per D33.

6. **Re-seed REALSPORTS_STORAGE_STATE_B64GZ when the JWT expires.**
   Real Sports JWTs last several months but eventually rotate. When
   cron-job1 starts logging StorageStateStale, re-run
   `scripts/realsports_login.py` locally, then re-encode + push:
   ```
   uv run python scripts/realsports_login.py
   B64GZ=$(gzip -c scraper/storage_state.json | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   # Update REALSPORTS_STORAGE_STATE_B64GZ on cron-job1 + cron-job2
   ```
